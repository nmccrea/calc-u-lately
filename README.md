# Calc-U-Lately

###### The latest in calculation.


**Ruby Version:** 2.4.0

**Rails Version:** 5.1

Calculations are performed by the `Calculation` service object. This is a bit of overkill for this project but is meant to demonstrate proper separation of concerns and extensibility.

The `Calculation` object is thoroughly unit-tested. Run 'bundle exec rails test' to run the test suite.

Thanks for your consideration!
